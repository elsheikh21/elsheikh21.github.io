# Blog-folio

**Goal:** Building a website to be able to replace my not interactive CV, and showcasing a lot of my projects.

Note: This was a template I just edited, template downloaded from `https://html5up.net/`, however, all the images but the background image are all of my own photos, as well as, all of the projects implemented.

I hope whomever come across it enjoy.
